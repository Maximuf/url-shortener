### User Stories
------------

  Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

  - I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

  - I can type the url into the input field and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response..

  - If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

  - When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
